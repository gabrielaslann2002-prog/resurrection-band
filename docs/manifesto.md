# Resurrection Band — Manifesto

The world is collapsing under relapse, burnout, and numbness.  
Apps give you streaks that break. Pills sedate, but don’t teach survival.  
Wearables drown you in graphs no one cares about.  

The Resurrection Band is not another tracker.  
It’s the world’s first on-wrist survival system — designed to pull you back to life in minutes.  

**Every pulse is proof.**  
A lifetime counter of survival moments — times you fought the urge, resisted the spiral, or endured the storm. It never resets.  

## What it Delivers
- Haptic rituals that regulate and ground.  
- Override sequences that stop cravings in real time.  
- The Global Pulse: a constantly rising worldwide counter of resilience.  

## Why it Matters
- Science-backed interventions: HRV breath pacing, EMDR-style bilateral buzz, vibrotactile calming.  
- Market size: addiction + mental health = trillion-dollar pain point.  
- Cultural power: not sterile wellness — raw, cinematic, Dead Dreamz-coded resilience.  

## The Hook
This isn’t jewelry.  
This isn’t wellness.  
**This is infrastructure for human survival.**
